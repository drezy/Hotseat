# Hotseat
Because we all have junk we shouldn't park on top of a router

Just in case you ever want to **NOT** sit right near/under/over the strongest wifi in the building and end up feeling like a  [Nora Volkow test subject](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c753886/clip-communicators-nora-volkow "Volkow Research").

## Synopsis

Wifi "bar" indicators ![alt text](https://github.com/drezy/Hotseat/blob/master/img/wifibars.png) do a great job of indicating the relative signal strength of the network you are currently connected to.

What about all the other networks near you?  If you don't mind inadvertently sitting on top of an industrial strength router it's your prerogative.

If not, you may find Hotseat useful.

## Motivation

The average wifi indicator only reports the signal strength of the network you are currently connected to.  
If there is a spiffy new Industrio-megapower-wifi-5000 unit in that cheap drop ceiling right 4 feet from your head it'd be kinda nice to know.
